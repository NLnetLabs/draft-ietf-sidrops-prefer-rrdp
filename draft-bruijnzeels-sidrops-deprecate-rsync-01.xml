<abstract>
<t>This document updates the profile for the structure of the Resource
Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) distributed repository <xref target="RFC6481"/>
by describing how the RPKI Repository Delta Protocol (RRDP) <xref target="RFC8182"/>
can be used, and stipulating that repositories which are made available
over RRDP are no longer required to be available over rsync.
</t>
<t>The Profile for X.509 PKIX Resource Certificates <xref target="RFC6487"/> uses rsync
URIs in the Authority Information Access, Subject Information Access,
and CRL Distribution Points extensions. This document leaves this unchanged,
meaning that rsync URIs are still used for naming and finding objects in the RPKI.
However, it is no longer guaranteed that objects can be retrieved using these
URIs.

<section anchor="motivation" title="Motivation">
<t>The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) <xref target="RFC6480"/> as originally defined
uses rsync as its distribution protocol, as outlined in <xref target="RFC6481"/>. Later, the
RPKI Repository Delta Protocol (RRDP) <xref target="RFC8182"/> was designed to provide an
alternative. In order to facilitate incremental deployment RRDP has been
deployed as an additional optional protocol, while rsync was still mandatory to
implement.
</t>
<t>RPKI Repository operators are still required to provide 24/7 up-time to their
rsync infrastructure, as long as the requirement to support rsync stands. Thus,
the benefit that they get from supporting RRDP, which enables the use of content
delivery networks (CDNs) for this purpose, is limited.
</t>
<t>And as long as not all RPKI Repositories support RRDP, Relying Party software is
still required to support rsync. Because there is a lack of rsync client
libraries, this is typically implemented by calling a system installed rsync
binary. This is inefficient, and has issues with regards to versioning of the
rsync binary, as well as reporting errors reliably.
</t>
<t>This document requires that:
- All RPKI repositories support RRDP as a highly available service
- Relying Parties support and prefer RRDP over rsync
- RPKI repositories support rsync for debugging purposes only
</t>
<t>This way all parties are freed of direct operational dependencies on
rsync.

  use this protocol as follows.
</t>
<t>NEW:
  When a Relying Party performs RPKI validation and learns about a
  valid certificate with an SIA entry for the RRDP protocol, it MUST
  use this protocol. It MUST NOT depend on object retrieval for this
  certificate over rsync for validation, although it MAY still use
  rsync access for other purposes under the understanding that availability
  is not guaranteed.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="rsync-uris-as-object-identifiers" title="Rsync URIs as object identifiers">
<t><xref target="RFC6481"/> defines a profile for the Resource Certificate Repository Structure.
In this profile objects are identified through rsync URIs. E.g. a CA certificate
has an Subject Information Access descriptor which uses an rsync URI to identify
its manifest <xref target="RFC6486"/>. The manifest enumerates the relative names and hashes
for all objects published under the private key of the CA certificate. The full
rsync URI identifiers for each object can be resolved relative to the manifest
URI.
</t>
<t>Though it would be possible in principle to build up an RPKI tree hierarchy of
objects based on key identifiers and hashes <xref target="RFC8488"/>, most Relying Party
implementations have found it very useful to use rsync URIs for this purpose.
Furthermore, these identifiers make it much easier to name object in case of
validation problems, which help operators to address issues.
</t>
<t>For these reasons, RRDP still includes rsync URIs in the definition of the publish,
update and withdraw elements in the snapshot and delta files that it uses. See
section 3.5 of <xref target="RFC8182"/>. Thus, objects retrieved through RRDP can be mapped
easily to files and URIs, similar to as though rsync would have been used to
retrieve them.
</t>
<t>Even though objects are no longer guaranteed to be available over rsync, we
still use rsync as the mandatory scheme in the CRL Distribution Points, Authority
Information Access, and Subject Information Access defined in <xref target="RFC6487"/>.
Changing this would introduce breaking changes which make deployment very hard
indeed: we would need to invent an alternative naming scheme, which would need
to be supported by all Relying Parties, before Certification Authorities can
issue any certificate or RPKI signed objects using these schemes.
</t>
<t>Furthermore, it is very convenient to have direct access to RPKI objects using
rsync for troubleshooting, debugging and research purposes.

<section anchor="deployment-phases" title="Deployment Phases">
<t>We recognise the following phases:
</t>

<section anchor="phase-0--rpki-repositories-support-rsync-and-optionally-rrdp" title="Phase 0 - RPKI repositories support rsync, and optionally RRDP">
<t>This is the situation at the time of writing this document. Relying Parties can
prefer RRDP over rsync today, but they need to support rsync until all RPKI
repositories support RRDP. Therefore all repositories should support RRDP at
their earliest convenience.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="phase-1--rpki-repositories-support-both-rsync-and-rrdp" title="Phase 1 - RPKI repositories support both rsync and RRDP">
<t>Once all repositories support RRDP, all Relying Party software should start to
prefer it over rsync.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="phase-2--all-rp-software-prefers-rrdp" title="Phase 2 - All RP software prefers RRDP">
<t>Although the tools may support RRDP, users will still need to install updated
versions of these tools in their infrastructure. Therefore it is expected that
there will be long tail of users who still depend on rsync to be highly
available.
</t>
<t>Measurements can help to determine the shape of this tail and can then help to
inform the technical community of when it would be safe to move to the next
phase.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="phase-3--no-operational-dependencies-on-rsync" title="Phase 3 - No operational dependencies on rsync">
<t>During this phase RPKI repositories will no longer be required to support rsync
as a highly available service.
